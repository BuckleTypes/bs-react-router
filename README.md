This is the Reason interop wrapper for [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/). **Note** that ReasonReact itself [already comes with a router](https://reasonml.github.io/reason-react/docs/en/router.html).

However, it's possible that you have an existing JS application that uses React Router, that you'd like to bind to (though we still recommend doing a direct conversion to ReasonReact's own router instead; it's likely less effort than to use this binding). In that case, please ping @chenglou if you'd like to own this repository.
